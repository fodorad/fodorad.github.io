						<h2>Abstract</h2>
						<p>Dyadic and small group collaboration is an evolutionary advantageous behaviour and the need for
							such collaboration is a regular occurrence in day to day life. In this paper we estimate the perceived
							personality traits of individuals in dyadic and small groups over thin-slices of interaction on four
							multimodal datasets. We find that our transformer based predictive model performs similarly to
							human annotators tasked with predicting the perceived big-five personality traits of participants.
							Using this model we analyse the estimated perceived personality traits of individuals performing tasks
							in small groups and dyads. Permutation analysis shows that in the case of small groups undergoing
							collaborative tasks, the perceived personality of group members clusters, this is also observed for
							dyads in a collaborative problem solving task, but not in dyads under non-collaborative task settings.
							Additionally, we find that the group level average perceived personality traits provide a better predictor
							of group performance than the group level average self-reported personality traits.</p>

			<h2>Research Questions</h2>
				<p>Using estimates on perceived personality applied to both small groups and dyads involved in a task
				oriented interaction we examine the time-averaged personality states of group members in order to address
				the following research questions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Does the perceived personality of members within a group cluster?</li>
					<li>Does the measured perceived personality of either the group members or group average change between tasks?</li>
					<li>Finally, is the group level perceived personality a stronger predictor of group performance than self-reported personality?</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Proposed method</h2>
			<p>In order to approach these research questions we examine multiple datasets which focus on dyadic and
				small group interaction. Importantly, we justify the generalisability of the developed method we make
				use of the provided perceived personality annotations present in the MULTISIMO dataset. For the dyadic
				case we analyse the UDIVA dataset and for small groups the Emergent Leader
				(ELEA) and AMI meeting corpus. Both the UDIVA
				and AMI meeting corpus provide the opportunity to explore the potential changes in perceived personality
				over different tasks. Despite the limitation that the ELEA dataset provides only a single interaction session
				for each group, it provides a useful metric of group performance for the completed task.</p>
			<p>These features are used with a transformer based model. The architecture is built on multi-head attention units
				that transform one modality to another. As we utilise three unique modalities, the model comprises of six
				cross-modal transformers. The final output of the network is the prediction of the big-five personality traits,
				however we use emotional stability represented as the inverse neuroticism score.</p>
			<img class="img-fluid rounded middle" src="../../images/projects/grouppersonality/model.png" alt=""/>
			<p>Estimation of the big-five traits is made over a sliding window of duration 15 seconds and a stride
				duration of 1 second, providing a snap-shot of the perceived personality traits. From the big-five traits
				we determine a higher-order two-factor meta-trait representation of personality.
				These meta-traits are plasticity (PLA) and stability (STA), the former combining the traits of openness
				and extroversion and the latter conscientiousness, agreeableness and emotional stability.</p>

			<h2>Visualization</h2>
			<p>Illustrative sample of the temporal changes in the perceived personality meta-traits of plasticity (left) and
				stability (right). Coloured curves: Trait estimation for individual participants, where each participant is assigned a
				letter in place of a name for anonymisation in the dataset. Missing line segments: non-speaking intervals. Dashed
				line: average over participants. The grey shaded area gives the standard deviation of the individual values. Perceived
				personality tend to move together over time.</p>
			<img class="img-fluid rounded middle" src="../../images/projects/grouppersonality/trajectory.png" alt=""/>
			<p>On the following figure stability and plasticity values are visualized. a) First-impression personality state averaged over the full session duration.
				b) Each subplot shows the original averages as seen in a). Traits corresponding to the members of other group are
				highlighted by the red circles. c) Plasticity and stability determined from self reported big-five traits, re-scaled between
				0 and 1. d) Each subplot shows the original averages as seen in c). Traits corresponding to the members of other group
				are highlighted by the red circles. The observed group effect is strong in the first-impression personality state.</p>
